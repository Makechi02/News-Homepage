## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript DOM

### What I learned

This clamp() function in css lets you to create flexible and responsive design by specifying a range of values for a
property.

```css
.test {
  gap: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 1.5rem);
}
```

### Useful resources

  pattern and will use it going forward.

  This is an amazing playlist which helped me finally understand
  CSS Grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning CSS Grid.
